    <h1>Text in HTML</h1>
    <h3><em>How do we change text in HTML?</em></h3>
    <h1>This is a heading. Headings have really big sizes</h1>
    <h2>pretty big sizes</h2>
    <h3>big sizes</h3>
    <h4>less big sizes</h4>
    <h5>smaller sizes</h5>
    <h6>and really tiny sizes.</h6>
    <p>How do I make something change lines? By using another "p" element...</p>
    <p>...like this.</p>
    <p>It's also possible to <strong>bold</strong> certain words using "strong" or even <em>italicize</em> them using "em" (short for "emphasis").</p>
    <p><i>Don't forget, the "strong" and "em" elements also can affect things like screen readers. Read <a href="https://medium.com/@zac_heisey/when-to-use-strong-b-em-and-i-tags-in-your-markup-fa4d0af8affb">here</a> for more info about when to use strong, em, b, and i.</i></a></p>
    <p>Also, this element is considered a child element of the body element, meaning it inherits its parent's properties. (So is everything else above!)</p>
