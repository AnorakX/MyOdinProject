# MyOdinProject 
Welcome to my Odin Project, started 4/10/23.

4/10 
- Lessons completed: Elements and Tags, HTML Boilerplate, Working with Text, Lists
- Most of this is review as I've come across HTML before. I did however learn new ways to work with lists using the "start" "value" and "reversed" attributes

4/11
- Lessons completed: Introduction to Git, Git Basics, Commit Messages
- Much of this was new. I do need to develop a habit of keeping track of every change and commit often, with better commit messages (particularly using Conventional Commits).
