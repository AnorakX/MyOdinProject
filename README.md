# MyOdinProject 
Welcome to my Odin Project, started 4/10/23.

4/10 
- Lessons completed: Elements and Tags, [HTML Boilerplate](foundations/html-foundations/boilerplate.html), [Working with Text](foundations/html-foundations/working-with-text.html), [Lists](foundations/html-foundations/lists.html)
- Most of this is review as I've come across HTML before. I did however learn new ways to work with lists using the "start" "value" and "reversed" attributes

4/11
- Lessons completed: Introduction to Git, Git Basics, Commit Messages ([Git Notes](/foundations/git-cheatsheet.txt))
- Much of this was new. I do need to develop a habit of keeping track of every change and commit often, with better commit messages (particularly using Conventional Commits).
