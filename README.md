# MyOdinProject 
Welcome to my Odin Project, started 4/10/23.

4/12/23
- Lessons completed: [Links and Images](foundations/html-foundations/links-and-images.html), [Project: Recipes](foundations/recipes-project/index.html)
- Links and images were a good refresher for me, and doing my first project was pretty enjoyable (albeit tedious). I'm glad I was able to review my basic HTML as well as use yesterday's lessons to begin to use Git more thoroughly to track my progress.

4/11/23
- Lessons completed: Introduction to Git, Git Basics, Commit Messages ([Git Notes](/foundations/git-cheatsheet.txt))
- Much of this was new. I do need to develop a habit of keeping track of every change and commit often, with better commit messages (particularly using Conventional Commits).

4/10/23
- Lessons completed: Elements and Tags, [HTML Boilerplate](foundations/html-foundations/boilerplate.html), [Working with Text](foundations/html-foundations/working-with-text.html), [Lists](foundations/html-foundations/lists.html)
- Most of this is review as I've come across HTML before. I did however learn new ways to work with lists using the "start" "value" and "reversed" attributes
